# Reel Search

## Description

The point of this website is to provide users with a convenient movie search engine and to allow them to view movie information, trailers, movies in theaters, new dvd releases, and Oscar winners. It also allows the user to store a watchlist of movies for later viewing. Instead of requiring multiple searches on other websites, as well as creating watchlists solely through streaming services, this website streamlines all of those needs into one convenient location. This website allowed its authors an opportunity for growth in learning further design and media implementation.

## Usage

The user can use the link at the top right to switch to the watchlist page. A bit further down, the user can search a movie title to retrieve its trailer and movie information. A "Random" button will procuce a random movie trailer and its affiliated information. Once any movie trailer and information section is loaded, the user can click an "add to watchlist" button, and the movie title will then appear on the watchlist page. If the user enters an invalid title, a custom modal will pop up informing the user that the movie was not found and ask them to try again. Further down, the user can view trailers of upcoming movie releases. On the watchlist page, the user can navigate to different sections of the page via the links at the top right. The watchlist appears first with its posters in a carousel and a list of titles below. Further down is a carousel of movies currently in theaters with a link to view showtimes of movies in theaters. Below that is a carousel of movies recently released on dvd and streaming with a link to a full list of titles. Below that is a carousel for Oscar winning movies with a link to view a full list of titles. The user can easily navigate these pages without error.
